   <p>Why do innovation projects often get lost in the vast expanses of the rigid organization in corporate groups and companies with long-standing traditions? Why do they stand back and watch while the business models so successful over decades are turned upside-down by young startups? Why do the “big boys” so frequently find it impossible to respond to the challenges of the digital age sensibly and to renew their own operations?</p>
   <p>And the even more important question: What must be done to put an end to the agility killers in the company such as hierarchies, processes, and control systems and to replace them with a flexible and an effective innovation culture?</p>

 <h5>Our answer: Company Rebuilding</h5>
  <p>After all, 99% of all startups end in failure, and corporate groups and established companies have something that the newly founded companies lack: resources! Specifically, implementation experience and the ability to turn an idea into a product accepted by customers.</p>
  <p>Our approach is based on the principle of cell division and the creation of autonomous units in the company – taking advantage of the previous competitive advantages such as brand power, the know-how accumulated over years, and experienced employees.</p>
  <p>We help you on your journey from the clay layer to cell structure, from an unwieldly, inflexible corporate culture to an innovative, agile, and dynamically robust company of success.</p>
